  Generate a skeleton jobspec template.

# Command: init

The `init` command creates an example [job specification](/docs/jobspec/) in the
current directory that demonstrates some common configurations for tasks, task
groups, runtime constraints, and resource allocation. If passed a docker image,
the `init` command produces an example job file that runs that particular docker
image.

Please refer to the [jobspec](/docs/jobspec/) and [drivers](/docs/drivers/)
pages to learn how to further customize the template.

## Examples

Generate an example job file running the docker `redis:3.0.5` image:

```
$ nomad init redis:3.0.5
Example job file written to redis-3-0-5.nomad
```
